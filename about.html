          <p class="card-text">I am a CSE undergraduate at Thapar University, Patiala. I find my interests in competitive programming, 
              reason being I just love the way one needs to think different approaches to different challenging problems. Also I have recently
              started my journey in web development, Front End Development being the skill I have learnt, I am yet to explore Back End 
              development hence targetting to be a good Full Stack Developer. Coding is not just my part of coursework but also I love it
              as a hobby and interest. </p><p>Apart from problem-solving and analytical skills, I have also well developed soft skills.
              I have been a part of various teams during college projects and major hackathons where we as team members were not
              familiar with each other at the beginning, but as a part of those projects I learnt how to work in a team and handle it well.
              My past experiences in school/college has also emerged excellent leadership qualities in me. I am confident in communicating with
              people and I believe clear communication is the key to more efficiency in tasks where multiple people are involved. I followed
              art as a hobby and passion during school and participated in various multilevel competitions, thus making creativity a part of 
              my life. <p>Above all I am keen and quick learner, dedicated towards my to-do-list. My motto in life is to be better than yesterday.
              </p>
